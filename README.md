## Product Performance
* The products spread across different categories but the top three selling category in term of total revenue, order volume is Computers, Cell phone and Television. 
*	Despite the high volume of sales in the cell phone category with 96,000 orders, it is still unable to generate a higher revenue per unit
*	The music, video, audio and audio book category contribute the least in revenue and orders in relation to the other categories.

## Promotion analysis
* Since they are discounts during this promotional period, on their own they are unable to generate high level of sales in relations to regular sales with no discounts. This can be attributed to the number of days these discount period last and regular days with no discount are significantly more.
*	Seasonal discounts regardless have contributed to more than 50% of the company’s revenue, in terms of sales and order volume.
* Despite its contribution in the company’s revenue there still some underperforming promotions such as Christmas promotion which has significantly affected the sales during the end of the year and a few other such as summer promotion, Black Friday and anniversary promotion.
## Regional Comparison 
*	The Northwest zone generates the highest revenue contributing up to 10 million dollars in sales, followed by North Central, Southwest and Northeast Zones. 
* FCT (Federal Capital Territory) is significantly lagging in sales contributing about 1 million dollars in sales, this can be attributed to FCT zone having one state, on its own is still contributing higher than some individual states.
*	In term of order volume Northwest, east and central remains the top contributor.
## Manufacturer and channel analysis 
* Fabrikam,Inc is the  highest revenue generating manufacturer for prime volt, contributing $12.3 million in overall revenue 
*	A few other manufacturers are up to par in contributing to the sales and growth of the company such as Contoso, Ltd and Adventure Works follow closely with $10.1 million and $7.6 million respectively, contributing a significant amount of revenue to the company.
*	Northwind Traders is severely underperforming year over year and has not been able to build revenue in the past four year only amounting as well as Litware, Inc with each generating less than $2.2million or less.
* The online channel dominates with $11.7 million in revenue followed by resellers with $7.3 million and the mobile outlets contributes significantly less at $5.06 million.
* The store sales which is the physical channel generates the largest chunk of total revenue at $32.19 million suggesting a strong reliance on physical locations.

  # Recommendations 
*	While computers and cameras are the top performing categories, empasis should be made on leveraging these products that fall into the category to boost growth but also consider strategies for the underperforming segments like Audio.
* Since there is a significant difference between the high and low performing segment, there is also room for exploring upsell/cross-sell, for instance selling audio devices with Television or computers instead of selling them alone. 
*	Prime volt can continue to focus on its strength by increasing marketing efforts to further capitalize on the North West’s strength.
* FCT shows underperformance in relation to other zone due to having one state,on its own its generating revenue but a regional sales push could unlock untapped potential
*	To curb consistent fluctuations and maintain the peak period, consider aligning future promotions, product launches, or marketing efforts with these months to maximize sales.
*	The downward trend at the end of 2014 needs attention and the company can consider factors like shift in competition, customer preference changes or issues with the products. To reverse decline, they can launch targeted marketing campaign. The online channel is a growing source of revenue, so investment in better user experience, targeted advertising, and e-commerce campaigns to grow this channel even more would be beneficial to the growth of the company
*	In order to maximise the contribution of seasonal sales to the company’s revenue, consider creating seasonal campaigns around key periods, such as mid-year and holiday sales to maximise returns during peak times.
*	Implementation of loyalty program to encourage repeat purchases throughout the year.
* The mobile outlet channel appears underdeveloped compared to other channels. If this is an important target market, consider strengthening mobile marketing strategies or improving user experience on mobile platforms.
*	The online channel is a growing source of revenue. You could invest in better user experience, targeted advertising, and e-commerce campaigns to grow this channel even more.
*	Since Fabrikam and Contoso are the top manufacturers driving sales for the company, consider strengthening relationships for exclusive deals, new product launces or preferential pricing.
